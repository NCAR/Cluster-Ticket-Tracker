# List of ideas, features, fixes, improvements...

<<<<<<< HEAD
* FIX:


* IMPLEMENT:
  * Write a config option for a unit test... instead of running pbsnodes -a, you specify a csv file to read 
  * Do we want a flagfile config option and if not False: check and clear file on node
  * Check_MK? When ctt has a FATAL err, send to Nagios


* TEST:
  *WORKS: If comment and THIS, THIS takes issuetitle.
  *WORKS: If NO comment and THIS, will show THIS
  *WORKS: If NO comment and NO THIS, use Unknown Reason
  *WORKS: If comment and NO THIS, use comment
  *WORKS: If node is powered off, what will show in title, etc. Shows Unknown Reason
  *WORKS: Add a comment then resume node. comment should clear at resume.
  *WORKS: Test clush timeout.
  *WORKS: Test unlinking of THIS at resume
  *WORKS: Does /etc/nolocal get unlinked when resumed.
  *WORKS: Test with real flag filename
